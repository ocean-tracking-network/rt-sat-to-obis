"projectDescription": "Fitting seals with these miniaturised loggers provide the ability to collect valuable oceanographic measurements in regions often inaccessible to ship-based researchers, whilst also providing information on seal behaviour. Data is transmitted in near real-time using the Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (Argos) system."
